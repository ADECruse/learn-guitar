Guitar Teaching Website (WIP)
-----------------------------------------

This App's goal is to provide a online platform for my friends Guitar teaching business.

A good friend of mine is expanding his Guitar teaching business online, although he has hired a web design company for this purpose I thought it would be fun, to try to make one myself and help me learn more about web development.

Built using the Rails 5 and Bootstrap frameworks.

Features
--------

### Completed

* Dynamic one page design that lists information about the teaching service and prices.

* User registration and log-in.

* Video page for logged in users that shows all the video tutorials on how to play the Guitar.

### To-Do

* Add Skype API to enable easy access to 1 to 1 Guitar lessons through Skype.

* Add user dashboard that would display and give feedback on the users guitar learning progress.

* Re-think the user experience and make the whole site more stream lined and focused.
